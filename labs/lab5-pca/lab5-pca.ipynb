    "\n",
    "There are many perspectives on principal components analysis (PCA). PCA is variously described as: a dimension reduction method; a method of approximating covariance structure; a latent model; a change of basis that optimally describes covariation; and so on. How can these seemingly distinct views be compatible with a single method?\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple answer is that PCA has a very wide range of applications in which it serves different purposes. Sometimes it is applied to find a few derived variables based on a large number of input variables -- hence, 'dimension reduction'. At others, it is used to interpret covariation among many variables -- hence, a 'covariance approximation'. With different objectives come different perspectives. \n",
    "\n",
    "In PSTAT100, we'll try to look beyond this and focus on the core technique of PCA: *finding linear data transformations that preserve variation and covariation*. In short, we'll focus on the *principal components* (PC) part of PCA, taking the following view.\n",
    "* **Principal components** are _**linear data transformations**_. \n",
    "* The **analysis** of principal components is _**varied depending on the application**_.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll keep an open mind for the time being about what the analysis (A) part of PCA entails. So, what does it mean to say that 'principal components are linear data transformations'? Suppose you have a dataset with $n$ observations and $p$ variables. As a dataframe, this might look something like the following:\n",

We know from exploring the correlation matrix that employment rate, unemployment rate, and income per capita are all related, and similarly child poverty rate and poverty rate are related. Therefore, the positively-loaded variables are all measuring more or less the same thing, and likewise for the negatively-loaded variables. \n",

    "Essentially, then, PC1 is predominantly (but not entirely) a representation of income and poverty. In particular, counties have a higher value for PC1 if they have lower-than-average income per capita and higher-than-average poverty rates, and a smaller value for PC1 if they have higher-than-average income per capita and lower-than-average poverty rates.\n",

    "4. Try to come up with a description of less than 4 words.\n",
    "\n",
    "This system is based on the following ideas:\n",
    "* a high loading value (negative or positive) indicates that a variable strongly influences the principal component;\n",
    "* a negative loading value indicates that\n",
