    "# Lab 3: Data visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Data visualizations are graphics that represent quantitative or qualitative data. In PSTAT100 you'll be using the python visualization library Altair, which is built around the pandas dataframe. Altair creates visualizations by mapping columns of a dataframe to the various elements of a graphic: axes, geometric objects, and aesthetics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizations are immensely useful tools in exploratory analysis as well as presentation, and are thus an essential tool for the data scientist. Visualizations can help an analyst identify and understand structure and patterns in a dataset at a high level and act as a guide for how to proceed with an analysis. Additionally, they can be an extremely effective means for conveying results to a general audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructing effective visualization is usually an iterative process: plot-think-revise-plot-think-revise-plot-think-revise. In exploratory visualization often it is useful to produce a large quantity of plots in order to look at data from multiple angles; in this context, speed is helpful and details can be overlooked. By contrast, presentation graphics are typically highly refined versions of one or two exploratory plots that serve as communication tools; developing them involves attention to fine detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you'll become familiar with the basic functionality of Altair -- that is, the basic kinds of graphics it generates and *how* to construct these graphics from a dataframe -- and get a taste of the process of constructing good graphics. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, plots are constructed by:\n",
    "1. creating a *chart*\n",
    "2. specifying *marks and encodings*\n",
    "3. adding various *aesthetics*, and \n",
    "4. resolving display issues through *customization*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical tutorial**. You'll get an introduction to each of these steps:\n",
    "* Creating a chart object from a dataframe\n",
    "* Encodings: mapping columns to graphical elements\n",
    "* Marks: geometric objects displayed on a plot (*e.g.*, points, lines, polygons)\n",
    "* Aesthetics: display attributes of geometric objects (*e.g.*, color, shape, transparency)\n",
    "* Customization: adjusting axes, labels, scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualization process**. In addition, our goal is to model for you the process of constructing a good visualization through iterative revisions.\n",
    "* Identifying and fixing display problems\n",
    "* Discerning informative from non-informative graphical elements\n",
    "* Designing efficient displays\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background: elements of graphics\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand why Altair (and other common visualization libraries like ggplot in R) works the way it does, it is helpful to have a framework for characterizing the elements of a graphic. Broadly speaking, graphics consist of sets of **axes**, **geometric objects** plotted on those axes, **aesthetic attributes** of geometric objects, and **text** used to label axes, objects, or aesthetics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Altair constructs plots by mapping columns of a dataframe to each of these elements. A set of such mappings is referred to as an *encoding*, and the elements of a graphic that a dataframe column can be mapped to are called *encoding channels*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Axes\n",
    "\n",
    "Axes establish a reference system for a graphic: they define a space within which the graphic will be constructed. Usually these are coordinate systems defined at a particular scale, like Cartesian coordinates on the region (0, 100) x (0, 100), or polar coordinates on the unit circle, or geographic coordinates for the globe.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Altair, axes are automatically determined based on encodings, but are customizable to an extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Geometric objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometric objects are any objects superimposed on a set of axes: points, lines, polygons, circles, bars, arcs, curves, and the like. Often, visualizations are characterized according to the type of object used to display data -- for example, the *scatterplot* consists of points, a *bar plot* consists of bars, a *line plot* consists of one or more lines, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Altair, geometric objects are called *marks*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aesthetic attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "The word 'aesthetics' is used in a variety of ways in relation to graphics; you will see this in your reading. For us, 'aesthetic attirbutes' will refer to attributes of geometric objects like color. The primary aesthetics in statistical graphics are color, opacity, shape, and size. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Altair, aesthetic attributes are called *mark properties*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Text\n",
    "\n",
    "Text is used in graphics to label axes, geometric objects, and legends for aesthetic mappings. Text specification is usually a step in customization for presentation graphics, but often skipped in exploratory graphics. Carefully chosen text is very important in this context, because it provides essential information that a general reader needs to interpret a plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Altair, text is usually controlled as part of encoding specification.\n",
