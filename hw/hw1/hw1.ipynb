    "## Background \n",
    "\n",
    "The [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html) (BRFSS) is a long-term effort administered by the CDC to collect data on behaviors affecting physical and mental health, past and present health conditions, and access to healthcare among U.S. residents. The BRFSS comprises telephone surveys of U.S. residents conducted annually since 1984; in the last decade, over half a million interviews have been conducted each year. This is the largest such data collection effort in the world, and many countries have developed similar programs. The objective of the program is to support monitoring and analysis of factors influencing public health in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each year, a standard survey questionnaire is developed that includes a core component comprising questions about: demographic and household information; health-related perceptions, conditions, and behaviors; substance use; and diet. Trained interviewers in each state call randomly selected telephone (landline and cell) numbers and administer the questionnaire; the phone numbers are chosen so as to obtain a representative sample of all households with telephone numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw BRFSS survey data is submitted to the CDC for processing and compilation into a single dataset. In the process, a number of 'derived variables' are calculated based on questionnaire responses and appended to the dataset -- a simple example is weight in kg, derived from respondents' weights reported in pounds. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take a moment to [read about the 2019 survey here](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2019.html) (follow the link!) and familiarize yourself with the information that is publicly available. This includes data and documentation pertaining to sampling methodology, questionnaires, variable coding, derived variables, and response rates."

This is an opportunity to practice critical thinking about data collection, computational skills, and communicating results clearly and correctly.\n",

    "* slicing (selecting rows and columns);\n",
    "* index manipulation (renaming and rearranging);\n",
