    "## Background \n",
    "\n",
    "Gender achievement gaps in education have been well-documented over the years -- studies consistently find boys outperforming girls on math tests and girls outperforming boys on reading and language tests. A particularly controversial [article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1684489) was published in Science in 1980 arguing that this pattern was due to an 'innate' difference in ability (focusing, of course, on mathematics rather than on reading and language). Such views persisted in part because studying systematic patterns in achievement nationwide was a challenge due to differential testing standards across school districts and the general lack of availability of large-scale data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is only recently that data-driven research has begun to reveal socioeconomic drivers of achievement gaps. The [Standford Educational Data Archive](https://edopportunity.org/) (SEDA), a publicly available database on academic achievement and educational opportunity in U.S. schools, has supported this effort. The database is part of a broader initiave aiming to improve educational opportunity by enabling researchers and policymakers to identify systemic drivers of disparity.\n",
    "\n",
    "> SEDA includes a range of detailed data on educational conditions, contexts, and outcomes in school districts and counties across the United States. It includes measures of academic achievement and achievement gaps for school districts and counties, as well as district-level measures of racial and socioeconomic composition, racial and socioeconomic segregation patterns, and other features of the schooling system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The database standardizes average test scores for schools 10,000 U.S. school districts relative to national standards to allow comparability between school districts and across grade levels and years. The test score data come from the U.S. Department of Education. In addition, multiple data sources (American Community Survey and Common Core of Data) are integrated to provide district-level socioeconomic and demographic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "A [study of the SEDA data published in 2018](https://cepa.stanford.edu/content/gender-achievement-gaps-us-school-districts) identified the following persistent patterns across grade levels 3 - 8 and school ears from 2008 through 2015:\n",
    "* a consistent reading and language achievement gap favoring girls;\n",
    "* *no* national math achievement gap on average; and\n",
    "* local math achievement gaps that depend on the socioeconomic conditions of school districts.\n",
    "You can read about the main findings of the study in this [brief NY Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/13/upshot/boys-girls-math-reading-tests.html).\n",
